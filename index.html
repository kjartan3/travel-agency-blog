        <h1>Trip to Iceland</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Land of Fire and Ice</h3>
        
        <p>Iceland, often called the "Land of Fire and Ice," is a country of stunning contrasts. Its dramatic landscape is
            shaped by active volcanoes, geysers, and geothermal hot springs, alongside vast glaciers and ice caps. Located in
            the North Atlantic, Iceland’s natural beauty includes breathtaking waterfalls, rugged coastlines, and the famous
            Blue Lagoon. The island’s unique geology results from its position on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the North
            American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. Known for its vibrant Viking history and the aurora borealis, Iceland is
            a land of raw nature, adventure, and enchanting folklore.</p>
